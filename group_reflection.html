        <h2>Renee</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Reflecting on this assignment and working as a part of the HydroKnow team I am thankful to work with such
            like-minded, creative, and friendly people. A handful of times we had a few of us that had personal events
            surface and attending meetings were not possible. We all supported one another and were understanding of
            each of our personal lives and how this can impact group projects such as HydroKnow. We updated one another
            and took opportunities to catch one another up within the Microsoft Teams application. This experience has
            highlighted the importance of communication when working in a group environment which I feel will be
            invaluable as I continue to grow my skills within IT and work on future team projects.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            I think the most significant event that surfaced in our team was the absence of one of our group members in
            the initial project. This did then mean that we all had to pick up an extra piece of work for this project,
            but we all made it work. Personally, I feel as though I haven’t contributed as much as the previous
            assignment but whether that is because we already had the frameworks for both sections of the assignment;
            GitHub, Canva report and went quite in-depth during our initial project. I feel humbled to have worked in
            such a collaborative team and look forward to possibly working with one another in the future.

        <h1>Group Reflection</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Being a member and a part of HydroKnow has been an overall enjoyable and rewarding experience for each of
            us. As Jarrad mentioned earlier, our group found its feet quite quickly and after a couple of team member
            shuffles we began to communicate early on. The founding members of the group, Will and Parth, used their
            initiative by recruiting the most active individuals based on discussion posts and weekly live lectures. The
            implementation of this method worked in Will and Parth’s favor and us as a team.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            At the beginning of forming HydroKnow, we admit there was a communication lull after our first meeting and
            reflecting on this, we could have utilised this time more effectively. We have taken this on board as a
            learning opportunity. Communication via teams worked well towards the end of week 5, 6 and 7. Frequent
            communication mishaps were corrected in the early days by simply just tagging/ mentioning one another in the
            comments left on the Microsoft Teams posts page. Certain days showed a decrease in activity and therefore
            altering our meeting days was necessary.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            We all discussed the requirements from specific tasks and created an approach within the team. This
            consisted of delegating the large aspects of the assignment to ensure research on these areas was quickly
            achieved. As we began learning more about one another, it was clear that we are all like-minded individuals
            who have created a positive study experience overall.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Our communication throughout the end of the assignment has been excellent, we have informed one another when
            unable to attend meetings, added topics in the meeting minutes to later discuss and provided one another
            feedback where appropriate. This communication has enabled us to work collaboratively as a team and
            individually apply our strengths to meet our specific skill set, whether it was writing content or pushing
            and pulling commits on GitHub. Each of our contributions has since led to an organised, clean, and
            consistent project pathway as Jacqui mentioned above.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Throughout this experience and within many teams in any environment, there can be team members that may
            contribute more than others. Reflecting on this, we knew it would be easier for those members with busier
            schedules to complete the tasks that were less tedious. Our group members consist of diverse backgrounds
            with some being mature age with a young family and others are at the beginning of their new careers. We have
            each held one another to a high regard as each of us strives to achieve high expectations of ourselves.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            As two members were having difficulties with their GitHub pages, Renee and Parth, this made it challenging
            to all share one another’s content. This had a somewhat negative impact on the rest of the team as this
            aspect was something that should have been produced from assignment one a few weeks earlier. Luckily, Renee
            was both able to rectify this, which in turn made it easier for us all.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            One of the revelations we had as a group was the ease and simplicity that Microsoft Teams offered us.
            Collaborating on this platform was straightforward, easily learnt and provided us with the ability to store
            our group work in a very organised way. This platform managed our individual tasks, set reminders and we
            were able to update each other when something was achieved, formatted and ready for our repository.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Moving forward, the six of us have now established a solid foundation to improve on areas that we may have
            overlooked in the previous tasks. After the submission, creating an open forum to discuss potential areas
            for improvements is something that will be of great benefit to us all. We all agree on the fact that we may
            have left the GitHub side of things a little later than we should have by focusing on the content perhaps
            more than we anticipated. This is a valuable learning opportunity that we can all grow from. As Renee
            indicated, we hope to continue this level of communication when collaborating on our next group task.
