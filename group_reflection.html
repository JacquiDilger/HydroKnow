        <h1>Individual Reflections</h1>
        <h2>Will</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            What an incredible group of individuals to work with for this group assignment! Being my first Uni subject,
            I will admit that I was on the nervous side for how the whole group work aspect would work online, but now,
            on the other side, I must admit that I am blown away by how well we all worked together and the quality of
            the work that we produced. Everyone was super collaborative, helpful and hardworking! This meant that
            whenever we delegated tasks out, you could trust that each person would complete each task, and to a very
            high standard as well!
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            If there were something that we, as a group, could improve, I would say be more on top of the meeting
            agendas and minutes. I didn’t involve myself much in those documents. However, in future, I will intend to
            make more of an effort to contribute to working on those documents in the lead up to each meeting and during
            them, to ensure that all sessions run smoothly and that task isn’t left to just one member, as it was many
            times during this assignment.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            It surprised me how well we were able to work together, often in group work, disagreements happen, and it is
            hard to get solid collaborative work done. Still, everyone was so easygoing and open to new ideas. This
            meant we all worked together really cleanly and effectively, which created a healthy group environment, and
            I looked forward to catching up with everyone in our weekly meetings.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            A key takeaway from this group work is reinforcing how crucial communication is and how important it is to
            stay on top of the tasks you are given. I felt I let the team down by not getting the raspberry pi fully up
            and running, despite myself being charged with that task, so I will endeavour to, in future group work, make
            sure that when I commit to something, I also produce the work expected of me, or, earlier on, let the group
            know that I don’t think I will be able to complete the task and come up with a compromise, which is what
            ended up happening in this assignment.
        </p>

        <h2>Jarrad</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            You couldn’t have asked for a better first group to have for the major Assignments of this course. Each
            member of the group communicated well and worked as a team. Looking back on our journey, I can confidently
            say that every aspect of this Assignment went well, from the early forming of our group to team meetings and
            also to contributions. We reflected on our Assignment 2 feedback and on the reflections, we wrote as a
            group, and improved upon our teamwork and communication. This time around we left ourselves more time to
            finish the report and the website and didn’t need to pull any all-night study sessions to finalize last
            touches.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            If we were to improve in one area, I would say that we needed a more robust task/ checklist, as we
            progressed through the Assignment it became difficult to see what had been complete and what still required
            work, it would also help with defining which team members have worked on what tasks to better understand
            what they have contributed and where each member was up to.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            One thing that was surprising was how much I felt I have learned in a 12-week period, by working with this
            group we pushed each other further than we may normally have gone on our own, which led to working harder
            and doing more research than I typically would have done, enabling me to broaden my knowledge, specifically
            on raspberry pi computers and python programming.
        </p>

        <h2>Renee</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Reflecting on this assignment and working as a part of the HydroKnow team I am thankful to work with such
            like-minded, creative, and friendly people. A handful of times we had a few of us that had personal events
            surface and attending meetings were not possible. We all supported one another and were understanding of
            each of our personal lives and how this can impact group projects such as HydroKnow. We updated one another
            and took opportunities to catch one another up within the Microsoft Teams application. This experience has
            highlighted the importance of communication when working in a group environment which I feel will be
            invaluable as I continue to grow my skills within IT and work on future team projects.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            I think the most significant event that surfaced in our team was the absence of one of our group members in
            the initial project. This did then mean that we all had to pick up an extra piece of work for this project,
            but we all made it work. Personally, I feel as though I haven’t contributed as much as the previous
            assignment but whether that is because we already had the frameworks for both sections of the assignment;
            GitHub, Canva report and went quite in-depth during our initial project. I feel humbled to have worked in
            such a collaborative team and look forward to possibly working with one another in the future.
        </p>

        <h2>Jacqui</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Working with Team HydroKnow has been an amazing and informative experience throughout the semester for
            Information to IT. With everyone just beginning our Bachelor of Information Technology, many of us had no
            idea what to expect. I found myself nervous initially to have to work in a team setting where my final
            grades somewhat rely on other people; but as the weeks progressed, I was thankful to have a group of people
            around me that had an equal drive to complete everything to a certain academic level. The group were also
            very understanding of the intricate balance between school, work and/or personal life, which allowed us to
            accommodate for certain situations effectively and still have everyone contributing.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            We excelled in several areas, but I particularly enjoyed being a part of the consistent contribution from
            everyone, and creating high-quality content for the website, report, and relevant artefacts, such as the App
            Design Mockup or the Data Flow Diagram. Overall, I don’t believe Team HydroKnow lacked in any specific area,
            but we maybe could have improved on paying attention to finer details had we been given more time.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Throughout the assignment, we have all left a clear trail of consistent contribution from each member
            whether it be the through GitHub repository pushes, the Canva report editing or the separate artefacts that
            different members worked on.
        </p>

        <h2>Jeremy</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            With the major assignments now close to completion, I’m excited to be taking the next step in my IT studies,
            but sad to be farewelling our group. We are fortunate to have a motivated team with diverse skills and
            strengths, notably in design, technical, writing, and leadership. Team cohesion and effective communication
            has been our best strength however, particularly during the major project, enabling us to collaborate our
            diverse skills toward a successful project outcome.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            We approached the planning and management of the project in a linear manner, and I believe we could have
            benefited from spending more time in the initial stages developing a plan with clearer objectives,
            responsibilities, and project milestones. I think this approach would have allowed us to better prioritise
            our efforts in line with an overall strategy, and would be needed to keep the project on schedule through to
            completion.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            I was surprised and impressed with the way the team approached the technical elements of the project, not
            letting inexperience stand in the way of achieving our goals. Across the team many of us had no experience
            in web design, media production, hardware, and programming, but we tackled each of these elements
            effectively. This has increased my confidence approaching future IT projects which I may have otherwise been
            intimidated by.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            The exposure to group work has highlighted to me the challenge in planning achievable objectives and
            timeframes when planning complex projects. This experience will inform future projects, and piqued an
            interest in further developing project management skills that I can apply in an IT setting.

        <h1>Group Reflection</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Just as Jarrad said, we really couldn’t have asked for a better first group to be a part of for the major
            assignments of this course.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            One thing that we would all change is implementing a task planner from the beginning. Throughout assignment
            3 we had a bit of confusion in regards to what each of us were working on. By using a task planner, we would
            have been able to keep track of tasks in more of an organised fashion rather than rely on our next meeting
            to ask one another. We could have also used some of the Team’s built-in functions to help organise and
            delegate tasks. This is now something we will all reflect on in another group product in the future.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            From the beginning of assignment 3 to the end, we all gave ourselves more time to complete tasks. After we
            each completed tasks, we then began a new one. By doing this, we were not forced to complete so many
            components toward the due date, similar to what we did with assignment 2.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            As Will mentioned, we could have been a little more active in the meeting agendas and minutes as a group. We
            mostly found that by mentioning one another in comments in the chat or on the team's home page was adequate.
            This communication method worked quite well for us and perhaps for that reason we continued to use these
            methods.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Each of us contributed equally to either GitHub, Canva or the written content. It really helped having the
            content from the previous assignment already at a good standard. It also helped having us all contribute to
            the GitHub and Canva pages and pick up from where we left off previously. Where possible, we applied each
            other's strengths to certain aspects of the project which worked really well. The running joke throughout
            the assignment was that Jacqui was going to complete the entire assignment herself. The joke is still
            running, so thanks Jacqui, the backbone of this project!
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Jeremy raised a good point in regards to our team having so little experience with programming, web design,
            medias production, and hardware but we really did tackle each of these elements effectively between the 5 of
            us. We are all very much in agreeance with Jeremy’s statement, it has increased each of our confidence that
            we were otherwise intimidated by.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            As Jacqui mentioned in her reflection, each of us were constantly working on different aspects of the
            assignment and we each left a clear trail of the work produced. There was consistent contribution from every
            member whether this was on GitHub, our Canva report, creating artefacts or writing the report itself.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Throughout the assignment, which Renee briefly touched on, each of us had significant personal circumstances
            arise. Each of us were unable to attend a handful of meetings during this third assignment but every time we
            were all so accommodating to one another. We caught one another up, delegated tasks or helped each other
            finish tasks. It was a great feeling that we all knew we had everyone's backs no matter what came up.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Perhaps each of us have had previous negative experiences working within groups, however we were all very
            surprised at the high quality and standard of work we all produced together. From this experience,
            collectively, each of us have realised that with a great bunch of people, we really can develop an
            innovative project. As a group, we had nil disagreements, each of us were heard when pitching a new idea to
            the team and have really enjoyed this experience collectively.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            One surprising aspect that each of us learnt about one another, and quite possibly learnt about ourselves.
            Jeremy only ever submitted a perfect piece of work. Every ‘t’ was crossed and every ‘i’ was dotted. A
            perfectionist and one that takes such pride in everything he created for this and the previous assignment.
            Something else that we each learnt from Jeremy, if Jeremy wasn’t stressing, then we all knew not to stress.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Jacqui is an incredible html troubleshooter, there was always something that could be improved, and Jacqui
            would find out how, even if she was troubleshooting until 4am. 4am the following day, after that day.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Renee can spot an error from a mile away; she even edits her own edits and then re-edits those edits.
            English-US content couldn’t get past her. We think she created errors herself and then fixed those too.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Jarrad can create absolutely anything. Anything! We also think he learnt this about himself too. Jarrad
            approaches each task by nipping them in the bud. Simultaneously, he worked on every single task. If his
            raspberry pi arrived on time, he and Will would have already been selling HydroKnow to the fire brigades.
            And probably to New Zealand. And maybe Canada too.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            We all still have no idea why Will is studying to be a Plumber. We all think he has chosen the wrong career.
            Very talented young man that we all admired. We said Jacqui was and is the backbone of this project, but
            Will’s idea brought us all together.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            And, in summation, that is why, together, we all made an incredible team.
        </p>
