    <p style="text-align: justify">Out of all jobs presented here, Will’s role of ICT Systems Engineer was the most
        in-demand title in 2018, coming
        in at number 4 in Burning Glass’ <cite>Top Titles</cite> (2018). When ranking these jobs on demand according to
        the data, the
        order goes as follows: ICT Systems Engineer, Systems Administrator, Test Analyst, Web Developer, and Software
        Developer. Although Burning Glass doesn't mention any Cyber Security roles, Job Outlook provides evidence of
        ICT Security jobs indicating very strong future growth (Job Outlook, 2019). Analysing Job Outlook’s more recent
        collection of data, each job mentioned within our team has a projected growth of at least strong, with some
        gaining the “very strong” growth label. </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify">The technical skills that we as a team are aiming to gain throughout our study had
        far more overlap than originally expected, considering some of the roles are vastly different. Looking at
        Burning Glass’ data on <cite>Skills in Greatest Demand (Specialised Skills)</cite> (2018), SQL is the most
        in-demand specialised skill, which is essential to a few of our career paths. The ranking of our remaining
        specialised skills are the following: JavaScript at #2, Software Engineering at #15, Website Production at #17,
        Git at #21 and Python at #22. </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify">The three highest ranked specialised skills in IT that aren’t involved in our group’s
        required skill set are Java at #3, Microsoft Windows at #4, and Project Management at #5. I would argue however
        that all skills mentioned in the Burning Glass data would be applicable to any IT job, so although these weren’t
        explicitly listed as skills needed for each member’s ideal job, everyone would benefit from all 25 skills
        mentioned in the data.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify">Our general skills had almost the same amount of overlap as the IT-related skills
        did. This was as expected for the general skills category; most skills that are mentioned are a necessity to any
        successful career, not just within the IT field. According to Burning Glass’ data on <cite>Skills in Greatest
            Demand (Baseline Skills)</cite> (2018), the most in-demand general skill is communication. This is
        unsurprising as communication (or lack thereof) can be the make-or-break of a team and its tasks. Following on
        from communication; problem solving is #2, teamwork / collaboration is #5, detail-oriented is #8 and management
        is at #19. </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify">The three unmentioned highest-ranking general skills in our required skill set are
        organisational skills at #3, writing at #4 and planning at #7. Again, although these skills aren’t explicitly
        listed as necessities for our ideal jobs, we would all value greatly from mastering most, if not all skills
        mentioned in the provided data. </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify">After analysing the data in its entirety, it would be ignorant not to acknowledge
        that we as members didn’t pick the most in-demand jobs, however I don’t believe that this is any indicator of
        bad decision-making. To perform at your absolute best, you have to pick something that you are interested in,
        and most importantly enjoy. Although our opinions haven’t changed on our ideal jobs, we are aware of the most
        prevalent roles in IT now and can utilise it to make informed decisions in the future. </p>
