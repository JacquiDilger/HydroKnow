        <h2>Will</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            I think our team worked well together. We worked efficiently, everyone completed their tasks, and group
            meetings were very productive. One thing that could have been improved is the GitHub system. When using
            branches, we found there were way too many conflicts, making it a real hassle to commit updates to the code.
            To resolve this, we tended to communicate in team chat if someone was working on the code to avoid too many
            conflicts occurring.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Something surprising was how creative everyone was with their ideas! It was fantastic to work with people
            who all have their own unique ways of thinking and doing things and then bringing that together in this
            assignment. This also provided a great platform to meet other people with similar passions to myself, and I
            found it a valuable learning opportunity, learning from my other team members capabilities. Something I
            learnt about working as a team is how important communication is. It is vital to attend meetings and produce
            the work I have completed. By maintaining momentum both individually and as a team, we can ensure we are all
            making progress and looking ahead at future tasks.
        </p>
        <h2>Jarrad</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Our group was well formed from the beginning. William and Parth were the 2 who originally decided to get
            together and ‘recruited’ the others so to speak. They did this based on the activity of the members, only
            choosing people who were active on the weekly webinars and who were contributing towards the discussion
            boards. This led to an active group with high productivity.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            We had our first meeting one week before the submission of the previous assignments deadline and started to
            get the ball rolling early. From there we had a bit of quiet period in which not much communication
            happened, and this is where we could improve for next time, about 10 days later we organized the second
            meeting and got a start on the assignment properly. From that date communication has improved drastically
            and targets have been achieved consistently.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Moving forward to subsequent assignments I hope to keep the pace and communication that we have now and to
            further progress in this aspect. This is my first adult study class, and it was surprising to me the level
            of dedication by fellow students. I am also very grateful to be working with a group who have a passion for
            completing the work to a high standard.
        </p>

        <h2>Renee</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            As a group, I think we have worked quite well together. In the beginning I noticed a change in group
            dynamics as we all started to get to know one another. Jarrad became chair of most of the meetings which
            worked well. His mannerism kept us all on track throughout and we were all given opportunities to raise
            concerns or express our opinions.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Communication early on could have been enhanced multiple ways. Initially we should have scheduled meetings
            after our first meeting and created a GitHub repository to establish a starting point. I also feel as though
            I have let the team down by running into a few technical difficulties on my GitHub page. This made it
            difficult for my team members to extract specific data within jobs roles and trying to complete their tasks
            too. I was thankful to everyone who helped me troubleshoot this and offer guidance.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Overall, I think we have a great team and each of us have a different type of skill set that complemented
            one another’s. I am looking forward to our next project together and expanding on our skill set, increasing
            our communication and applying this to achieve an overall grade that we are each proud of.
        </p>

        <h2>Jacqueline</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            I think that this team has great potential. Everyone in the group is collaborative in nature; there hasn’t
            been any case of someone being left behind or not putting in effort. We have all worked to be adaptive and
            driven in terms of getting the necessary delegated work done, which has been a great experience.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Improvements for next time could include keeping a clearer ‘to-do’ regime, however this isn’t detrimental as
            everyone has done a great job keeping track of their own tasks. Although Jeremy and I were latecomers to the
            group, everyone was welcoming and ready to get the ball rolling. I was surprised at just how detail-oriented
            everyone has been. We’ve all put in a massive effort to keep things organised, clean and consistent, and
            we’ve done a great job staying productive and involved.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            I’ve learnt that working within a team with other likeminded individuals can be a great asset to not only
            our work and our grade, but our overall study experience. I look forward to working with Team HydroKnow in
            the future.
        </p>

        <h2>Jeremy</h2>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            I believe the team meetings were productive and improved as we progressed. Initial meetings involved open
            discussion of overall requirements of the task, which was particularly helpful with a task involving several
            disparate components. As we progressed, meetings shifted to updates of individual member’s progress, and
            seeking help from the group on issues they encountered which encouraged everyone to stay productive.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Between scheduled meetings, there was naturally still a requirement for coordination between members, either
            to answer ad hoc queries, or requiring submissions from other members. We tended to use Teams posts/comments
            for this coordination, but I felt these requests were difficult to keep track of at times and could have
            benefited from greater use of task assignment and tracking tools.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Towards the end of the project, with the pressure of the deadline approaching, I was surprised to see that
            the group’s collaborative efforts and assistance with other members really seemed to strengthen. Despite
            everyone having their individually assigned components to work through, there was a very strong commitment
            to help each other out, offering suggestions, looking at code and design elements.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Tying into the research on personality types and their influence on a group, this assignment has
            demonstrated to me the strength that a team can gain with a varied cross-section of personalities. I think
            our group each brought different strengths, which contributed to the overall success of the project.

            Being a member and a part of HydroKnow has been an overall enjoyable and rewarding experience for each of
            us. As Jarrad mentioned earlier, our group found its feet quite quickly and after a couple of team member
            shuffles we began to communicate early on. The founding members of the group, Will and Parth, used their
            initiative by recruiting the most active individuals based on discussion posts and weekly live lectures. The
            implementation of this method worked in Will and Parth’s favor and us as a team.

            At the beginning of forming HydroKnow, we admit there was a communication lull after our first meeting and
            reflecting on this, we could have utilised this time more effectively. We have taken this on board as a
            learning opportunity. Communication via teams worked well towards the end of week 5, 6 and 7. Frequent
            communication mishaps were corrected in the early days by simply just tagging/ mentioning one another in the
            comments left on the Microsoft Teams posts page. Certain days showed a decrease in activity and therefore
            altering our meeting days was necessary.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            We all discussed the requirements from specific tasks and created an approach within the team. This
            consisted of delegating the large aspects of the assignment to ensure research on these areas was quickly
            achieved. As we began learning more about one another, it was clear that we are all like-minded individuals
            who have created a positive study experience overall.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Our communication throughout the end of the assignment has been excellent, we have informed one another when
            unable to attend meetings, added topics in the meeting minutes to later discuss and provided one another
            feedback where appropriate. This communication has enabled us to work collaboratively as a team and
            individually apply our strengths to meet our specific skill set, whether it was writing content or pushing
            and pulling commits on GitHub. Each of our contributions has since led to an organised, clean, and
            consistent project pathway as Jacqui mentioned above.

        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Throughout this experience and within many teams in any environment, there can be team members that may
            contribute more than others. Reflecting on this, we knew it would be easier for those members with busier
            schedules to complete the tasks that were less tedious. Our group members consist of diverse backgrounds
            with some being mature age with a young family and others are at the beginning of their new careers. We have
            each held one another to a high regard as each of us strives to achieve high expectations of ourselves.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            As two members were having difficulties with their GitHub pages, Renee and Parth, this made it challenging
            to all share one another’s content. This had a somewhat negative impact on the rest of the team as this
            aspect was something that should have been produced from assignment one a few weeks earlier. Luckily, Renee
            was both able to rectify this, which in turn made it easier for us all.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            One of the revelations we had as a group was the ease and simplicity that Microsoft Teams offered us.
            Collaborating on this platform was straightforward, easily learnt and provided us with the ability to store
            our group work in a very organised way. This platform managed our individual tasks, set reminders and we
            were able to update each other when something was achieved, formatted and ready for our repository.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            Moving forward, the six of us have now established a solid foundation to improve on areas that we may have
            overlooked in the previous tasks. After the submission, creating an open forum to discuss potential areas
            for improvements is something that will be of great benefit to us all. We all agree on the fact that we may
            have left the GitHub side of things a little later than we should have by focusing on the content perhaps
            more than we anticipated. This is a valuable learning opportunity that we can all grow from. As Renee
            indicated, we hope to continue this level of communication when collaborating on our next group task.
