    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        ‘HydroKnow’ is a Water Tank level indication system that links with the CFA to provide vital information on
        water availability in the case of a bushfire occurring nearby.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        Essentially, how it would work, a sensor system is set up in the client’s water tank; this sensor collects
        information on how much water is available in the tank. It would also provide data such as the tank is full
        or
        getting too low etc., then display this on a mobile or web application.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        The CFA could gain access to this information via an app login, and then in the case of a bushfire,
        emergency
        services can log in and look in that area, how much water is in water tanks, and then be able to plan where
        to
        draw water from in case they need it for their firefighting efforts.
    </p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        There are currently solutions to indicate tank water levels digitally, but not to the extent that the
        ‘HydroKnow’ concept does.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        The ability for a customer to have a clear view of how much water is available in their water tank would be
        very
        helpful, especially during droughts and summer. This idea is significant as the innovative side is how the
        CFA
        can use this information to fight fires.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        As Australians know, bushfires can rip through bushland, destroying homes, businesses and even lives in some
        cases. The CFA must have the water they need to fight fires. This software solution gives them an in-depth
        overview of what water they have at their disposal to fight fires, which would prove incredibly useful for a
        strategic and successful firefighting effort.<i>“The 2019/2020 bushfire season was one of the worst in
        recent
        times, in the world” </i> (Hughes, C 2021).
    </p>
    <img src="images/bushfires.jpg">
    <p style="color:#212529; margin-top: 0px;">Source: <a
            href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50862349">https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50862349</a></p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        According to Statistica.com, 4.3 million hectares of conservation land was burned in this bushfire
        season, with
        13 million hectares burned in NSW and ACT, and an estimated 1.5 billion wildlife animals who lost
        their habitats
        in the fires dying across Australia. Bushfires are no joke, so the CFA must know what water is
        available to fill
        up their trucks and continue fighting fires.
    </p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        This software and hardware solution’s features would include:
    </p>
    <ul style="text-align: justify;">
        <li>See up to date information on how much water is remaining in each water tank, presented in
            litres form as
            well as percentage capacity. (If multiple tanks are present on a property, the application will
            display
            separate information for each tank. There will also be an overview data set available of how
            much water is
            available in total on the property).
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>A sensor placed within the tank to detect water levels that then connects to a transmitter
            mounted on the
            outside of the tank. It then connects to the internet (depending on if it's available) or
            contains 4G
            reception capabilities to transmit the data to servers, updating what’s displayed in the app.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>This water data is also accessible by the CFA, where in case of a bushfire, can see what water
            is available
            in the area and prepare a strategy for collecting it. They will be able to see who lives on the
            property,
            initiate an alert if they require the water, and communicate with the person/s dwelling on the
            property.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>This data can be accessed and presented in visually appealing graphs and text form on either a
            mobile or web
            application. The design goals are to present the information clearly, in an attractive and easy
            to read
            format.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>The customer can choose whether to keep a record of water levels in the tank and use this data
            to present
            trends of their water usage, with a ‘Tips’ feature recommending if they should try to change
            their water
            usage habits to save water.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>There would be a ‘Guides’ section on the application, giving all the necessary information
            required to set
            up and use the system and a troubleshooting guide in case of an error. Also included in this
            ‘Guides’
            section, information would be available on the best actions to make in case of a fire situation.
            This would
            include things such as how to prepare and set up an evacuation plan with templates for how they
            would handle
            their possessions and other assets.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>This application could also have the potential to work together with state emergency apps in
            terms of guides
            and resources to help people best plan in case of a bushfire emergency and ensure the safety of
            themselves
            and their family/precious assets.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>There would be customer support available, too, with options to call over the phone, email or
            set up a video
            conference in case of an issue with the software or hardware.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>The transmitter and sensor would need to have a rugged design that ensures it will endure harsh
            Australian
            elements, being waterproof, dust-proof and UV resistant.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Due to the nature of the data, including names and addresses, it would be necessary for the data
            traffic to
            be end-to-end encrypted to ensure that the data of the individuals using the service to be
            protected and
            only accessible by the correct parties.
        </li>
    </ul>

        According to HB 230-2008, ‘Rainwater tanks are defined as structures and are to be classified ‘Class
        10b’ as
        defined in the Building Code of Australia.’ In some area’s depending on if the network utility
        operator’s water
        supply is not available, there are specific requirements associated with supply of water for
        firefighting,
        unique to the area.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        There are 3 main types of water tank: polyethylene tanks, metal tanks and concrete tanks
        which can be installed above ground, underground or subfloor.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        Sizing of these are dependent on various factors including annual rainfall for the region, roof
        catchment size, water demand and if mains water is available on
        the property. Due to this, it’s important that HydroKnow is designed to work in any tank, regardless
        of shape or
        size. All penetrations into a tank are required to be sealed to minimise the risk of contamination,
        as a result
        of this, all components for this technology will need to be sealed, and any penetrations made sealed
        also,
        either with silicone or a dektite.
    </p>

    <h3>Marketing</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        When approaching a marketing strategy for HydroKnow, we need to assess not just the market for the
        product but
        also the way this product will help communities and in turn, the nation. There is certainly a market
        for
        HydroKnow and this is evident in the recent bushfires across Australia. The benefits of this product
        can save
        homes, land, animals, and more importantly, lives.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        The demographic that HydroKnow will be focusing on is the adult population of all sexes. This type
        of
        demographic is more likely to become attracted to the implementation of this product and therefore
        support its
        entirety. By target advertising on social media and through other external social media channels, we
        can utilise
        those with high public profiles such as the Chief Officer of the CFA, Jason Hefferman and the CEO,
        Natalie
        MacDonald. By not targeting the typical social media influences, this well help reach and ensure
        audiences that
        this product is of serious nature.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        By assessing realistic marketing strategies and goals, this will help save money
        overall on advertising costs and will not cheapen the brand. To distribute the brand and the product
        something
        like a fundraising gala and dinner will ensure that it reaches certain audiences. If commissioners,
        politicians,
        and someone like Celeste Barber <i>(Australian Comedian)</i> were to also carry the brand, it will
        only increase our
        brand and sales. During the last New South Wales and Victorian bushfire, Celeste Barber helped raise
        $51 million
        dollars on her social media accounts (McKinnell, 2020). By increasing audiences and the overall
        sales of
        HydroKnow, this will then increase the collection of data which will then increase the overall
        capabilities of
        this product. The benefit of compiling substantial amounts of data will ensure that if a bushfire
        were to occur,
        the users of HydroKnow have been able to distribute the pools of water on their property for the
        fire brigades
        to access from both land and sky perspectives.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        The HydroKnow data can also be utilised in an opposite environment scenario; in rural country
        Australia, many
        farmers are on the brink of a water crisis. If farmers had the ability to assess their water
        consumption and
        plan for a dry summer all by looking at their phone, this would be game changing! Farmers will be
        able to plan
        with their seeding, particularly those who primarily farm within greenhouse. If their tanks have ‘x’
        amount of
        water and each week they consume ‘x’ amount, they will have the ability to foresee a water shortage
        before there
        is one.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        In summary, the marketing for HydroKnow will purely be based on data collection, the public's
        opinion, and
        climate variability. These three components will steer the direction for the suitability of a
        marketing
        strategy.
    </p>

    <h3>How does HydroKnow compare to other solutions on the market?</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        The closest comparison we can make to a design already on the market exists within the invention of
        the
        “smartwater sensor” (Smartwater 2021). This design serves as an inspiration for how we will build
        our product,
        it has a high UV resistant casing and durable design to survive severe weather conditions. A solar
        panel option
        for water tanks stored in direct sunlight and a power supply built-in for indoor tanks. The app
        design also
        serves as a good steppingstone offering trending data for the user regarding water level and usage
        and has
        weather forecasting to predict the next rainfall.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        For all the similarities, we would like to change some aspects and some areas of new development.
        One of the
        main differences between this product and our design is the sensor used; we would be implementing an
        ultrasonic
        water level sensor that would sit above the water's surface. We have chosen this option as
        ultrasonic sensors
        are typically very accurate with error readings of up to 0.1%, there is even long-range sensors that
        can
        reliably measure tall tanks up to 40m.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        The other options of sensors include a float sensor, which cannot be used for remote sensing and
        requires the user to physically check the float, and pressure sensors which sit close to
        the bottom of a tank and measure the pressure distortion from the sensor to the surface of the
        water. However,
        these sensors require higher maintenance and usually suit open environments instead of an enclosed
        water tank
        (360 Tanks 2021). Using the ultrasonic sensor should also allow for longevity of the product by
        having minimal
        if any contact with the water. To further improve upon the smartwater sensor, we plan to embed cloud
        data
        storage into the design using 4G and Wi-Fi (if applicable).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        Each user will be able to view their data, but this data would also be encrypted and securely stored
        within a cloud server that is only accessible by authorized CFA
        staff to utilise in the event of a bushfire or severe drought, allowing them to view water levels
        from numerous
        sources in one location.

    <h3>Tools and Technology</h3>
    <h4>Hardware - Tank Level Sensor and Processing</h4>
    <img src="images/raspberrypi.jpg">
    <p style="color:#212529; margin-top: 0px;">Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 4GB CE06425 Raspberry Pi Australia</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        The primary hardware is based around a Raspberry Pi 4, equipped with an ultrasonic sensor. This
        sensor
        technology is ideal due to the lack of moving parts that may malfunction over time, instead using
        solid-state
        ultrasonic transmitter and receiver to measure water levels. Testing for how this will work
        practically will
        commence in Assignment 3 once Will and Jarrad have received the Raspberry Pi's they have ordered and
        will begin
        experimenting with the best ways to use the ultrasonic sensors to gather the water level data.
    </p>
    <h4>Raspberry Pi Connectivity</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        Wi-Fi/ Ethernet: Basics models of HydroKnow will offer Wi-Fi/ ethernet connectivity, suiting smaller
        properties
        with a tank closer to their house and within network range. Raspberry Pi 4 hardware includes both
        connections as
        standard.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        Cellular: Most users are expected to benefit from cellular connectivity which will be available by
        upgrade.
        Cellular connectivity is possible through commercially available Raspberry Pi modules and serviced
        through
        established telecommunication networks via customer account and SIM.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        Low Power Wide Area Networking (LPWAN) technology is particularly suited to IoT sensors that don’t
        require a high data rate and offer advantages of low
        power consumption and cost (Pelaez 2017). Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) is one such standard particularly
        suited to
        the HydroKnow use case. Modems such as the <a target="blank"
                                                      href="https://www.iot-store.com.au/products/sim7020e-nb-iot-hat-raspberry-pi">SIM7020E
        NB-IoT
        HAT</a> for Raspberry Pi enables this connectivity
        on Raspberry Pi. Low data SIM plans suited to IoT implementation are also available that would suit
        HydroKnow
        implementation, such as <a target="blank"
                                   href="https://www.telstra.com.au/small-business/internet-of-things/data-sim-plans">Telstra
        IoT
        Data SIM plans</a>.</u>
    </p>

    <h4>Cloud Integration</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        Integrating the data flow between deployed HydroKnow devices and cloud based application servers can
        be
        facilitated through most major cloud service providers.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        AWS and Google Cloud are 2 examples that offer subscription tools with specific functionality to
        manage IoT devices. Utilising these services simplifies the
        development and management of the project, and provide a scalable platform for further development.
        The <a target="blank" href="https://cloud.google.com/iot-core">Google Cloud IoT Core</a> product is
        a cost-effective method to manage and scale the HydroKnow service by offering:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device management,</li>
        <li>End-to-end security and,</li>
        <li>Access control.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Application Development</h4>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        The use-case of HydroKnow suits the user application to be supported on both mobile and desktop
        platforms. A
        robust mobile platform is a particular priority for CFA frontline responders, while CFA coordination
        agencies
        would benefit from desktop access to integrate with their fixed IT platform. Property owners would
        similarly
        have mixed-use, requiring mobile access for remote and convenient access, while when conducting
        administrative
        and analytical tasks may prefer a desktop solution.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        Development of the mobile application would best be approached using a common programming language
        that can
        support both the iOS and Android platforms. C# (C Sharp) is an object-oriented programming language
        that can be
        used to develop on both platforms. The Xamarin framework allows developers to access native iOS and
        Android
        capabilities with C# (Chebbi 2021).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        Due to the application’s requirement for accessing server hosted data, the backend functionality
        controlling it
        is a vital component. Research indicates this is the most complex technical component of a project
        of this
        nature (Dorogokupets 2020). Subscription-based Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) tools that provide these
        functions
        would simplify the project, reducing both the development time and ongoing management overhead. In
        order to
        integrate with the proposed IoT cloud service provider in the example above, utilising <a target="blank"
                                                                                                  href="https://firebase.google.com/">Google's
        Firebase</a> service
        would be a suitable option. These services facilitate functions such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data storage,</li>
        <li>Geolocation,</li>
        <li>Authentication,</li>
        <li>Push notifications and,</li>
        <li>User management.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Skills Required</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        By leveraging PaaS and BaaS tools, the project can focus on front-end development requirements.
        Competency would
        be required in multiple coding languages to develop the mobile and web applications, and to program
        the
        Raspberry Pi device.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        Due to the networked nature of the service, an understanding of cybersecurity issues and strategies
        is important
        to effectively protect users, devices and data to ensure peace of mind for users and to comply with
        regulatory
        requirements.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        With respect to hardware, experience using Raspberry Pis is required, while installing the equipment
        would need
        basic installation skills.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        Industry data presented in this report suggest these skills are in strong demand, so the project is
        likely to
        face recruitment competition, if it is to scale, however these are fairly common skills within the
        IT industry.
    </p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        Once this project is complete, it will provide a unique, innovative platform for clients and the CFA
        to see
        water tank level data presented in a clean, easy to read format! It would give the CFA vital
        information to help
        them plan firefighting efforts, contain guides and information for clients on how to best prepare
        for bushfires,
        and give them advice on what to do in an emergency. The impact of this application would be
        widespread across
        Australia and hopefully, become a standard installation with water tanks to equip and prepare
        Australians for
        bushfire seasons.
    </p>

    <h3>Brand Kit</h3>
    <p style="text-align: justify">
        In preparation for Assignment 3, we've designed a brand kit concept for the branding and colours we
        would use as
        a guide on all 'HydroKnow' designs!</p>
