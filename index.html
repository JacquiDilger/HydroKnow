            <p style="text-align: justify">
                Hi, I’m Renee, I grew up in small beach-side community in country South Australia, always
                running around on friends’ farms or tending to the many animals my siblings and I had on our
                property. This contributed to my healthy and active lifestyle and from there I became interested
                in the healthcare industry completed a certificate III, IV and an advanced diploma in dental
                radiography and surgery. <br><br>

                I then began studying and working with the South Australian Ambulance Service (SAAS) where I
                began working alongside paramedics as an Ambulance Officer in both rural and metropolitan areas.
                When the team and I weren’t out on calls we were all glued to our phones, the rise of my
                solitaire addiction began. I continued to apply myself to my studies while working with the
                emergency services and juggling a full-time, part-time position and study. I had the opportunity
                to work for both government and private sectors before later joining the Australian Defence
                Force as an Army Medic. <br><br>

                Each of these industries has taught me a vast range of skills while highlighting the importance
                of teamwork. What I enjoy about these elements is the implementations of numerous methods while
                working as a team can enhance. In the winter months I began working as a sports trainer for an
                AFL Club which is where I really saw the elements of teamwork come together.

                My name is Jeremy Hill-Douglas, the next member of HydroKnow! I am a 37-year-old home-espresso
                enthusiast, SCUBA-diving fanatic, living in Sydney with my wife Ally and our 1-year-old son Alfie. I
                grew up in central Queensland on a large sheep station and have lived in too many towns and cities
                since. I’ve been working in the aviation industry for the last decade, starting out as an air
                traffic controller and now working in an aircraft operations center, with a particular focus on the
                IT systems that support it. This exposure to IT functions in my current role has reinvigorated an
                interest from my younger years and attracted me to pursuing further studies in the field.

            <p style="text-align: justify">
                My name is Jarrad Sutherland in team ‘HydroKnow’, I am 32 years old and happily married with 3
                children. My wife and I were both born in Australia and have lived here all our lives. I graduated
                Secondary college in 2007 and attended Chisholm TAFE in 2008 studying ‘Games Programming Cert IV’.
                After completing the certificate, I enrolled in the Australian Defence Force Reserves for 4 years
                where I learned valuable lifelong lessons around leadership and teamwork. I have been working as a
                restaurant manager for the last 10 years and have since completed a Diploma of Management
                (Hospitality).
                Most of my IT experience has been through self-paced learning using online tutorials and YouTube
                videos. I studied Information Technology in Secondary College but a lot of the information I learnt
                at that time is now outdated. In the last 2 years I have finally decided to improve upon this
                skillset and have been undertaking online short courses in Cyber security and Networking.
                My main hobbies include video games, basic coding tutorials and making coffee. With video games, I
                like a wide range of genres, for me the story is the main thing I play for. I have also recently
                discovered my joy for solving basic coding challenges, with only recently attempting them online
                through Scrimba.

                My name is Jacqueline (Jacqui) Dilger, I’m 21 years old and I am a part of team HydroKnow. I live in
                Launceston, Tasmania, but I have had the utmost pleasure of enduring not just one, but two Victorian
                lockdowns (I’m still currently in one!). I am a massive homebody, so I cannot wait to be home with
                my friends and family. Although I’m not the most tech-savvy person in the world, I have a great
                passion for everything IT, which all stems from my childhood surrounded with developing technology
                and gaming. As far as my technical experience in IT goes, I gained a Certificate III in Print
                Communications in 2020, and studied a basic Computer Science course in grade 12, but I haven’t made
                the leap to the IT industry as a field yet.

                Parth Kulkarni is my name. I was born in Pune, Maharashtra, India, and migrated to Australia when I
                was 2.5 years old. One thing you may not know about me is that I enjoy finding and exploring new
                hiking spots, as well as watching Formula One races. I also love playing Cricket on the weekend for
                my Local Cricket Club. Please email me at S374358@student.rmit.edu.au if you want to communicate
                with me

                My interests in IT cover a lot of interests, but mainly in regard to the hardware side of things.
                This includes Hard drives, motherboards, RAM and basically the inner workings of a computer and a
                laptop. But also, how phones have evolved in the past years and how to fix them is very interesting
                to me.

                I’m an 18-year-old Australian, born and raised. My parents are both Australian too. Last year
                (2020), I completed Year 12 VCE and am also currently doing a TAFE course for Cert III Plumbing as
                I’m doing both this degree part-time and doing a Plumbing Apprenticeship full time! I’m presently
                1st year in that too. Interestingly, I’ve never broken a bone, but I’ve dislocated both my elbow and
                shoulder on my left-hand side! Thankfully, I’m right-handed, so it didn’t affect me too much when it
                happened, but I don’t want to relive having my arm stuck in a 90 degree cast for four weeks! I also
                play the saxophone and have completed my AMEB Grade 7 with Honour’s for Tenor Saxophone, which was a
                proud achievement!
